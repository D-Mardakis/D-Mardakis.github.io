                                What does it take to be a great bartender? A talent behind the stick, a creative flair,
                                and a willingness to experiment all help. But beyond making exceptional drinks, the
                                following 10 famous bartenders have gone one step further and changed cocktail
                                culture for the better, whether by writing essential books (like Harry Craddock),
                                reviving speakeasy culture (like Sasha Petraske), or bringing green innovations to
                                mixology in the modern-day (like Ryan Chetiyawardana).
                                Once you've read up on their accomplishments, do make yourself a tipple to toast with.

                                Jerry Thomas—most frequently known by his “Professor” moniker—is commonly considered the
                                father of American mixology. His Bartenders Guide, dating to 1862, was the first
                                such tome published in the country, and included
                                recipes for a number of pre-Prohibition cocktails that drinkers still enjoy today.
                                His image (he&apos;s mostly famously depicted in an engraving that sees him pouring
                                a flaming cocktail between two vessels) is
                                no less memorable.

                                Despite its name, Harry MacElhone&apos;s Harry&apos;s New York Bar didn&apos;t operate
                                out of the Big Apple. Instead, it was ensconced around the corner from the Opéra in
                                Paris, where it remains open to this day. During his tenure there, the Scottish-born
                                bartender served the likes of Ernest Hemingway and Humphrey Bogart, and pioneered
                                classic serves ranging from the White Lady to the French 75.

                                Known affectionately as Coley, Ada Coleman held illustrious sway over the American Bar
                                at the Savoy at the turn of the 20th century (and is still one of only two women to have
                                held the head bartender position). During her 23-year stint, she invented numerous
                                cocktails—including the Hanky Panky—and trained up Harry Craddock.

                                Few bartenders have had as much impact on cocktail history as Harry Craddock. The man
                                who, reportedly, shook the very last cocktail before Prohibition went into effect in the
                                US in 1920, Craddock later served as head bartender at the American Bar in the
                                1920s and 1930s. But what sealed his immortality was The Savoy Cocktail Book, which he
                                penned in 1930, and which is still regarded as an essential reference guide for
                                mixologists all over the world.

                                Following the burst of creativity that characterised bartending during the early 20th
                                century, cocktail standards suffered a decades-long dip. In London, it lasted virtually
                                until Dick Bradsell arrived on the scene. The father of the 1990s cocktail revival,
                                the peripatetic bartender worked behind the stick at a number of bars around town,
                                leaving a trail of modern classics—like the Espresso Martini and the Bramble—in his
                                wake.

                                helped revive interest in classic cocktail culture in the 1990s. He&apos;s also
                                won a James Beard Award, has written two essential cocktail books, and founded the

                                plotting the cocktail&apos;s resurgence stateside. When his Milk & Honey opened in New
                                York in 1999, it caused a seismic shift in global tippling culture. Drinkers moved
                                away from candy-coloured Cosmos and towards Prohibition-era serves, speakeasy
                                aesthetics, and artisanal ingredients.

                                The speakeasy-revival craze may have been born at Milk & Honey, but Jim Meehan really
                                helped the trend grow into a full-scale phenomenon. His PDT (Please Don&apos;t Tell) in
                                the Lower East Side—famously accessible only through a phone booth lodged in
                                the wall of a neighbouring hot dog restaurant—proved irresistible when it opened in
                                2007. The recent publication of Meehan&apos;s Bartender Manual only cements his
                                living-legend status.
